* After each click, check to see if the game has ended. If X or O wins, show the appropriate message. If there's a tie, show the appropriate message.
* After the game ends, reset the board.
* The first click on a empty cell should put X on the button. The next click on an empty cell should put O on the button. Follow this pattern for the rest of the game.
* If the user clicks on a button that already has an X or O, do nothing.
