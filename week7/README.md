## Question 2

Ask the user for a String. Display that String in reverse. **DO NOT USE LOOPS.**

## Question 3

Ask the user for a String. Determine if that String is a palindrome. A palindrome is a bit of text that reads the same 
in reverse. **DO NOT USE LOOPS.**

Ask the user for a list of integers. Display the greatest number in the sequence. Allow any non-integer to end the 
input. **DO NOT USE LOOPS.**

## Question 5

Create a class called **Telephone** that accepts a phone number in the constructor. For the purposes of this 
assignment, phone numbers may be any length. Make a method called **getPossibilities** that returns all possible 
**phonewords** for that phone number.

A **phoneword** is what you get when a phone number is converted in to letters. For example, the phone number 922-6966 could be re-written as ZAA-MZNO. Look at your phone to see where those letters came from.

**DO NOT USE LOOPS.**
