## Question 1

Make a class called **ToolBox** that implements the **GenericTools** interface. You will be implementing insertion sort 
in **Toolbox**.

The hardest part about this question is the syntax. Review each line very closely if something doesn't compile.

_Question1.java, GenericTools.java_

## Question 2

Make a class called **User** that stores a username and password. Implement the **Comparable** interface. Compare two users 
based on their password length. Shorter passwords come first.

If the passwords have the same length, then compare based on case-insensitive alphabetical order of the password. If 
the passwords match, compare based on the case-insensitive username.
